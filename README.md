# AcaScore
Creating a score-sorter for Academic Decathlon, making it easier for just about everyone.


## Goal
The goal of this program is to read student files and score spreadsheets, associate the students with their scores, then sort the scores in as many helpful ways as possible so that coaches have to sort by hand no longer. Instead of hand-sorting taking 3 hours, the program can handle the sorting in 30 seconds.

## Output
The other goal of this program was to make sure that the generated output is helpful, easy to read, and ready to print. The program generates large log files because the program outputs lots of debug information.
